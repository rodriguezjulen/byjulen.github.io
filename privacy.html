  <h1>Privacy Policy (GeoFlags)</h1>

  <h2>Controller</h2>
  <p>GeoFlags (educational app; no account registration required).</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li>We store locally on your device: quiz history, statistics (score, streak, accuracy), settings (theme, language, sounds), and level/XP progress.</li>
    <li>We send basic app events (e.g., installation and app open) to analytics providers for measurement and attribution: Firebase Analytics (GA4, without Ad ID) and/or TikTok App Events SDK. These providers may receive device identifiers (e.g., IDFV) and technical data (app version, device model, approximate IP), depending on system settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Purpose of Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide app functionality (show progress, achievements, personalize the experience).</li>
    <li>Measure basic app performance and installs for campaign attribution.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
  <p>Legitimate interest and/or consent (e.g., ATT in iOS), depending on your jurisdiction and system settings.</p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Local data remains on your device until you choose to delete it (by clearing history in the app or uninstalling the app).</li>
    <li>Analytics data is managed by providers according to their policies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We do not share your data with third parties except for the basic events sent to the analytics providers mentioned above, in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Advertising</h2>
  <p>Basic usage/install analytics only. We do not display ads in the app and do not engage in cross-app or cross-site tracking.</p>

  <h2>Your Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can limit tracking in iOS via Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking (ATT).</li>
    <li>You can clear your history in the app or uninstall it to remove all local information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>GeoFlags is educational and may be used by minors under parental supervision. We do not collect personal data or store sensitive information about children.</p>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Analytics providers may process data outside your country (e.g., in the United States or elsewhere). See the privacy policies of Firebase and TikTok for details.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Local information is stored using system mechanisms (iOS UserDefaults). Providers apply their own security measures.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can manage or delete your local data at any time within the app. You can also uninstall the app to remove all stored information.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect improvements or changes in the app. The updated version will be published in the app.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact the developer through the app's App Store listing.</p>

  <p><em>Note: This policy is also available within the app under Settings &gt; Legal &gt; Privacy Policy.</em></p>
